# üõ°Ô∏è Task 8: VPN Configuration and IP Address Verification

## üìò Objective
The objective of this task is to understand the role of **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)** in enhancing online privacy and security.  
By using a VPN service (ProtonVPN), the goal is to observe how it encrypts internet traffic and hides the user‚Äôs real IP address.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used
- **VPN Software:** ProtonVPN (Free Tier)  
- **Verification Tool:** [WhatIsMyIPAddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)  
- **System Used:** Windows 11 Laptop  
- **Browser:** Google Chrome

## üß≠ Steps Performed

1. **Chosen VPN Service**  
   Selected ProtonVPN as the free VPN provider for this experiment and created an account.

2. **Downloaded and Installed VPN Client**  
   Installed the ProtonVPN desktop application from the official website.

3. **Launched and Connected to VPN Server**  
   Logged into ProtonVPN and selected the **‚ÄúFastest Free Server‚Äù** option, which connected to a server in Zurich, Switzerland.

4. **Checked IP Address Before Connection**  
   Visited [WhatIsMyIPAddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com) before connecting to note the original IP address:  
   **103.42.196.64 (Kerala, India)**

5. **Checked IP Address After VPN Connection**  
   After connecting to ProtonVPN, the new IP was shown as:  
   **149.88.27.129 (Zurich, Switzerland)**

6. **Verified Encrypted Connection**  
   Confirmed that browsing was encrypted and location masked, ensuring online anonymity.

7. **Compared Connection Speed and Stability**  
   Noted a slight reduction in browsing speed due to encryption overhead.

8. **Documented Findings and Screenshots**  
   Included screenshots showing:  
   - ProtonVPN dashboard before connection  
   - IP before VPN connection  
   - IP after VPN connection

## üß© VPN Benefits and Limitations

### ‚úÖ **Benefits**
- Hides real IP address and physical location.  
- Encrypts all internet traffic for secure browsing.  
- Prevents tracking by ISPs and advertisers.  
- Enables access to geo-restricted content.  
- Protects data when using public Wi-Fi.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**
- May slightly reduce internet speed.  
- Free plans have limited server options.  
- Some websites block VPN traffic.  
- VPN does not guarantee total anonymity.  
- Connection drops can expose real IP if not secured with a kill switch.

## üß† **Conclusion**
Using ProtonVPN effectively masked the real IP address and routed internet traffic through a secure, encrypted tunnel.  
The VPN successfully changed the location from **India** to **Switzerland**, proving that it enhances privacy and online security.  
Despite a minor speed drop, VPNs remain essential tools for safe and private browsing.
